# React TodoList Application

A Todo List app built with React and Vite. Originally created during the **IBM Developing Front-End Apps with React** course, I've since upgraded it with new features and improved styling.

## Features

- Create todo categories with custom headings
- Add, complete, and delete individual tasks
- Persistent storage using localStorage
- Keyboard support (press Enter to add items)
- Responsive design

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Tech Stack

React 18.2 • Vite 5.2 • CSS3
